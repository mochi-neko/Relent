# http-result-unity

Provides a functional result and error handling
 for general process:`IResult` and HTTP communication:`IHttpResult` for Unity.

You 

1. You don't need to rely on null and exceptions to handle errors.
2. You are forced to think about (and handle) failures.
3. It makes the code a lot easier to read.

This library is inspired by

- [HttpClient - Error handling, a test driven approach](https://josef.codes/httpclient-error-handling-a-test-driven-approach/)
- [Functional C#: Handling failures, input errors](https://enterprisecraftsmanship.com/posts/functional-c-handling-failures-input-errors/)
